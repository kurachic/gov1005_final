A2J is a research clinic at Harvard Law School that runs randomized control trials in the legal system in order to assess how accessible various components are to pro se litigants - people without laywers. A2J is running several studies, and the divorce study is the first completed and published study. A2J randomized individuals between a treatment of legal representation or a control of referral to self-help materials, and as part of intake interviewed each potential participant for 45 minutes.
