**Abstract**

This project analyzes demographic and other data regarding participants in the Access to Justice Lab (A2J) at Harvard Law School's study of the accesibility of Philadelphia's divorce system.

A2J is a research clinic at Harvard Law School that runs randomized control trials in the legal system in order to assess how accessible various components are to pro se litigants - people without laywers. A2J is running several studies, and the divorce study is the first completed and published study. A2J randomized individuals between a treatment of legal representation or a control of referral to self-help materials, and as part of intake interviewed each potential participant for 45 minutes. I found that clients were overwhelmingly black, poor and early in middle age, with few significant differences across treatment groups and more significant differences across variables such as filing status at the point of interview, presence or absence of interpreter, and the status of Philadelphia Legal Aid's divorce practice status.

**What is the Access to Justice Lab?**

The Access to Justice Lab is a research clinic at Harvard Law School. The Lab runs randomized control trials in the legal system in order to assess how accessible various components are to pro se litigants - people without laywers.

**What is the Philadelphia Divorce Study?**

The Philadelphia Divorce Study randomized people looking for divorce into two groups - having a lawyer, and not having a lawyer but having self-help materials. The Lab partnered with Philadelphia Legal Assistance (PLA) and Philadelphia VIP to offer representation. Approximately a year into the study, budgetary restricts resulted in PLA terminating representation for divorce cases other than those involving domestic violence or other special circumstances, resulting in increased referrals to Philadelphia VIP.

**The Data**

The data here includes all 378 people who went through a 45 minute intake interview. 67 of these people were ultimately excluded from the study because their spouse had already filed for divorce. For the purposes of this project, these people have been included in order to examine the demographic and other information collected in the interview.

**Findings**

Most variables do not significantly differ by treatment status, which means that randomization for the experiment was successful. 

After PLA reduced their divorce practice, clients had significantly less assets, less liabilities and lower incomes. They also had less children and were more likely to be women, be black, and speak English in their household, and less likely to be Hispanic.

Clients whose spouse had already filed - clients who were ultimately excluded from the study - were more likely to have joint or sole ownership of some asset, be previously divorced, have a Protection from Abuse entered against him/her, and have a spouse making economic claims. Significantly more of their spouses were employed and those spouses had higher incomes and were more likely to be making economic claims against the client.

Clients who required interpreters were more likely to be Hispanic or of a race other than white, black or asian and more likely to speak a language other than English at home. There were less likely to engage in substane abuse and had less pensions/annuities, business, and loans. Their marriages were significantly longer and desertion was less likely to be grounds for divorce while indignities were more likely to be grounds for divorce.

In examining the entire sample, clients were generally unemployed or low income, black, in early middle age, and a substantial percentage were childless.
