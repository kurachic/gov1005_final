**Abstract**

This project analyzes demographic and other data regarding participants in the Access to Justice Lab (A2J) at Harvard Law School's study of the accesibility of Philadelphia's divorce system.

**What is the Access to Justice Lab?**

The Access to Justice Lab is a research clinic at Harvard Law School. The Lab runs randomized control trials in the legal system in order to assess how accessible various components are to pro se litigants - people without laywers.

**What is the Philadelphia Divorce Study?**

The Philadelphia Divorce Study randomized people looking for divorce into two groups - having a lawyer, and not having a lawyer but having self-help materials. The Lab partnered with Philadelphia Legal Services (PLA) and Philadelphia VIP to offer representation. Approximately a year into the study, budgetary restricts resulted in PLA terminating representation for divorce cases other than those involving domestic violence or other special circumstances, resulting in increased referrals to Philadelphia VIP.

**The Data**

The data here includes all 378 people who went through a 45 minute intake interview. 67 of these people were ultimately excluded from the study because their spouse had already filed for divorce. For the purposes of this project, these people have been included in order to examine the demographic and other information collected in the interview.

**Findings**

Most variables do not significantly differ by treatment status, which means that randomization for the experiment was successful.
