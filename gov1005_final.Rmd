The data I plan to use is from a study conducted by the Access to Justice Lab at Harvard Law School, where I work. The lab conducted a randomized control trial to evaluate the accessibility of divorce in Philadelphia, and basically found it was much more expensive to get a divorce than it really should be. For my final project, I'll be visualizing data from the study. For the purposes of this project, the data has been de-identified to maintain participants' privacy. There are 311 observations and 57 variables. The data is in the file called "SelectCovariates_13 Oct 2016.csv".
